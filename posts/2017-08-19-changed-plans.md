![I love my new car!](../src/images/2017-08-12/IMG_20170812_160838.jpg)

After two weeks in suburban Toronto, I finally managed to get an Ontario driver's license, a car and insurance for it!

I had originally planned to do a trip to the United States after that: Watch a day or two of golf at the [Solheim Cup](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2017_Solheim_Cup) in Des Moines, visit my host family in Omaha, NE and then watch the [total solar eclipse](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solar_eclipse_of_August_21,_2017) on August 21st [somewhere south of Omaha](http://xjubier.free.fr/en/site_pages/solar_eclipses/TSE_2017_GoogleMapFull.html?Lat=40.24599&Lng=-96.38306&Zoom=8&LC=1).

### The Solheim Cup

The plan was to leave on Wednesday, but I had already extended my stay in Toronto for another night, and I dind\'t start to make any detailed plans until I knew I would have a car by Thursday. So on Wednesday afternoon, while waiting for the car dealer to get the license plates ready, I looked at ticket prices for the Solheim Cup.

$60 per day. That\'s fine, I didn\'t expect this to be cheap. But, I have a car now (yay!), so what about parking? From their [FAQ](http://www.solheimcupusa.com/event-tickets/ticketing-faq):

> Q. Do I have to buy a parking pass for each day?  
A. It depends on which pass you purchase. The off-site parking pass ($35/week) provides weekly access (Monday-Sunday). The on-site Main Entrance parking pass is $40/day and you will need to select the specific day when buying.

WTF?!

The thing with the Solheim Cup is that on Friday and Saturday (I probably would have gone Saturday), there are a maximum of four groups on the course at any time. Everyone will obviously follow those four groups, so it will be crowded as hell. I was a volunteer as a scorer at the 2015 Solheim Cup in Germany. I was *inside the ropes*, it just doesn\'t get any better than that. So do I really need to pay $100 for a day of golf where I will be staring at someone else\'s back most of the time?

I wasn\'t so sure about that, so I checked the LPGA website to see if there\'s any regular tournament I could watch. As it turns out, they\'re playing the [Canadian Pacific Women\'s Open](http://www.cpwomensopen.com/) in Ottawa next week!  

### The solar eclipse

My first idea was to just skip the Solheim Cup, but still drive down to Omaha, visit my host family and watch the solar eclipse on Monday. If I left in Omaha on Tuesday or Wednesday, I could still be in Ottawa to see the tournament on Friday or Saturday.

I checked the weather forecast for August 21st, and it doesn\'t look very promising. There\'s a strong chance of showers, which means that even when it\'s not raining, the chance that it\'s cloudy is even higher. I have already seen a total solar eclipse when it\'s clouded ([Southern Germany, 1999](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solar_eclipse_of_August_11,_1999)), and there\'s nothing too spectacular about that - it just gets dark. 

The whole trip would have been a 3500 km drive. I really like my new car, but driving down there to experience another total solar eclipse without seeing anything is a chance I\'m not willing to take. I spent a lot of time in public transit in Toronto since I got here, so I really don\'t feel like sitting in a car for 36 hours within a week.

Additionally, just because CO2 is cheaper in Northern America doesn\'t mean it\'s doing any less damage to the environment.

### Last but not least

What\'s more, I just don\'t feel like going to the United States at the moment.

I think that if you vote populist, you have to realize that there\'s a flip side. In the case of the United States, it will not just keep Muslims out of the country. *America First* translates to *America Last* for me. I\'m guessing there\'s probably no clear definition of "Isolation" on Twitter.

I skipped a vacation to Florida in February partly because of that (I already knew I was going to Canada at the time, so I also wanted to save the vacation days and the money).

I have zero tolerance for the recent events in Charlottesville and how Trump handled it. I\'m aware a lot of Americans don\'t either, but it\'s your president, not mine. There\'s nothing I can do other than wait until you get your shit together.

### Conclusion

I\'ll just have a couple of coronas on Monday instead of seeing one.
